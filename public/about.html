<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello There!</p>
<p>
  I'm Sobhy. Originally from the state of Palestine, and I currently live in Saudi Arabia. 
  I work in the IT field, where I’ve found my true passion, coding. 
  From a young age, technology has always fascinated me, and now I get to explore it every day through my work and personal projects.
</p>

<p>
  I genuinely enjoy coding, especially when it comes to designing and building interfaces. 
  I love creating websites from scratch, experimenting with new ideas, and even breaking things just to figure out how to fix them
  it’s all part of the learning journey!
</p>

<p>
  Right now, I’m fully focused on learning and growing as a developer. 
  I’m taking serious steps to turn this passion into a long-term path by improving my skills, building personal projects, and exploring new technologies
</p>

<p>
  My dream is to one day work with international teams, travel, and create meaningful things through code.
  For now, I’m enjoying the journey, learning every day, experimenting, and pushing myself to get better at what I love
